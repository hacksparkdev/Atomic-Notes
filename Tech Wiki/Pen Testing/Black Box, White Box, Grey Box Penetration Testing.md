## Quick Notes
There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. 

#### Black Box  
The tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service. The tester would act as a regular user. 

#### Grey-Box Testing
This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. The tester will have some **limited** knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

#### White-Box Testing
This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.

The tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
