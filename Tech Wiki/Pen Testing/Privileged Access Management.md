**Privileged Access Management (PAM)** is a broader security strategy focused on controlling, securing, and monitoring access to critical systems and sensitive information by users with elevated privileges. Unlike **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**, which focuses on managing roles and identities, PAM deals with controlling access to systems and accounts that hold privileged credentials.

### Key Components of PAM:

1. **Credential Vaulting:**
    
    - Stores privileged credentials (passwords, SSH keys, API tokens) in a secure, encrypted vault, reducing the risk of exposure.
2. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:**
    
    - Provides temporary access to privileged accounts only when needed, reducing the attack surface.
3. **Session Management:**
    
    - Monitors and records privileged sessions for auditing and compliance. Some systems allow live session termination if suspicious activity is detected.
4. **Least Privilege Enforcement:**
    
    - Ensures users only have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks, aligning with the principle of least privilege.
5. **Password Rotation and Management:**
    
    - Automatically rotates passwords for privileged accounts at regular intervals or after each use, reducing the risk of credential theft.
6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    
    - Requires additional verification for privileged access, enhancing security.
7. **Access Control and Approval Workflows:**
    
    - Implements workflows for granting and revoking privileged access, often requiring managerial approval.
8. **Audit and Compliance Reporting:**
    
    - Generates reports on privileged access activities for compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX.

### Use Cases:

- **IT and Infrastructure Management:** Controlling access to servers, network devices, and databases.
- **Cloud Environments:** Managing access to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- **DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines:** Securing privileged credentials used in automation and deployment processes.

### Benefits:

- **Enhanced Security:** Reduces the risk of insider threats and external attacks by minimizing privileged access.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps organizations meet legal and industry-specific compliance requirements.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlines access management with automation and policy enforcement.
- **Incident Response:** Improves detection and response to suspicious activities involving privileged accounts.

### Popular PAM Solutions:

- **CyberArk**
- **BeyondTrust**
- **Thycotic (now Delinea)**

PAM plays a critical role in protecting high-value systems from breaches by ensuring that privileged accounts are carefully controlled and monitored. Would you like guidance on setting up a PAM solution or understanding how it integrates with other security measures?
