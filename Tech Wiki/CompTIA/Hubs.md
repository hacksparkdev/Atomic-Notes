## Quick Notes

A hub is a older piece of network hardware that was used to implement 10BASE-T and  100BASE-T
Ethernet cabling designs. They use the Star Topology. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/35001/images/9699-1637092513491-hub-star-topology.png)
Each computer will ignore any frames that do not match its MAC address. However, when lots of computers are in the same collision domain, performance is reduced, as only one computer can send a frame at any one time. If two computers try to send at the same time, there is a collision, and they must wait for a random period before trying again. The more computers there are, the more collisions. The computers contend for a share of the media bandwidth and all communications are half-duplex. Half-duplex means that the computer can send or receive, but not at the same time.
