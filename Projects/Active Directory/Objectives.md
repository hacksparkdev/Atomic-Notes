Creating an Active Directory (AD) lab for CompTIA A+ is an excellent way to get hands-on experience. Hereâ€™s a list of practical tasks and configurations to build your skills:  

---

### **1. Build the Lab Environment**
Before diving into activities, ensure your lab environment is properly set up:
- **Virtual Machines**:
  - Windows Server: Install and configure it as a Domain Controller.
  - Windows Clients: Join these to the domain to simulate a work environment.
- **Network Configuration**:
  - Set up a private or bridged network to connect your VMs.
  - Configure DNS on the Domain Controller since AD relies heavily on DNS.

---

### **2. Basic Active Directory Setup**
- **Create Organizational Units (OUs)**:
  - Set up OUs for departments (e.g., IT, HR, Sales).
  - Understand how OUs help with group policy application and user organization.
- **Add Users and Groups**:
  - Create user accounts with realistic naming conventions.
  - Create security and distribution groups, assigning users appropriately.

---

### **3. Group Policy (GPO) Practice**
- **Create and Link GPOs**:
  - Configure basic policies (e.g., disable Task Manager, enforce a screensaver with a password).
  - Link the policies to specific OUs and test the results.
- **Software Installation**:
  - Use GPO to deploy software like Google Chrome to domain computers.
- **Logon Scripts**:
  - Write a basic logon script to map network drives for users.

---

### **4. User and Permission Management**
- **Set File and Folder Permissions**:
  - Create shared folders with specific permissions for different groups (e.g., HR has access to HR files but not IT files).
- **Practice Account Lockout Policies**:
  - Configure and test password policies (e.g., complexity requirements, account lockout after failed attempts).

---

### **5. Networking with Active Directory**
- **Set Up DNS and DHCP**:
  - Practice configuring DNS zones and records.
  - Set up a DHCP server to provide IP addresses dynamically.
- **Test Name Resolution**:
  - Use tools like `nslookup` to ensure name resolution works in the domain.
  
---

### **6. Backup and Recovery**
- **Practice AD Backup**:
  - Use Windows Server Backup to back up the system state of the Domain Controller.
- **Restore AD**:
  - Simulate a failure and restore the Active Directory from a backup.

---

### **7. Monitoring and Troubleshooting**
- **Event Viewer**:
  - Explore the logs for authentication attempts, policy changes, and errors.
- **AD Tools**:
  - Use tools like Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and PowerShell for management tasks.
- **Network Diagnostics**:
  - Practice troubleshooting connectivity between domain-joined machines and the Domain Controller using `ping`, `tracert`, and `ipconfig`.

---

### **8. Security Configurations**
- **Implement Least Privilege**:
  - Assign roles to users to understand least-privilege principles.
- **Enable Auditing**:
  - Configure AD auditing to log user logon and logoff events.
- **Secure Authentication**:
  - Configure multi-factor authentication (if supported in your lab environment).

---

### **9. Scripting and Automation**
- **PowerShell**:
  - Create and manage user accounts using PowerShell cmdlets.
  - Export AD data (e.g., list all users or computers in the domain).
- **Batch Files**:
  - Create batch files for common tasks like drive mapping or network diagnostics.

---

### **10. Real-World Scenarios**
- **Simulate Common Issues**:
  - Experiment with account lockouts and how to unlock accounts in ADUC.
  - Remove a computer from the domain and rejoin it.
- **Practice Role Transfers**:
  - Understand how to transfer FSMO roles between Domain Controllers (if you have more than one).
